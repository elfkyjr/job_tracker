This script is a Python program that uses the tkinter library to create a graphical user interface (GUI) for a job tracking application. The program uses the pyodbc library to connect to a SQL Server database and execute SQL queries to retrieve and insert data into the JobApplications table. The program also uses the datetime library to insert the current date and time into the date_applied field when a new job is added. The GUI includes labels, entry fields, and a drop-down menu for the status field, as well as buttons to add, delete and view jobs. The program also has functionality to delete a selected entry from the table and GUI.
